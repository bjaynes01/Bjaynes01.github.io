summary: This was a program I developed in my programing languages course at Aurora University during my Junior year (2021).  It simulates a conveyer belt sorting system like those at either a packaging plant or maybe an airport luggage system. It has a GUI with interactions for reseting the system and pausing the conveyer belt.  While its main function is to sort items / luggage into different gates depending on where their tag (a randomly generated number) indicated they might go.
