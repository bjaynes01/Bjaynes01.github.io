This was my Aurora Univeristy Capstone project called GART - I was in a group of four tasked with developing an app of our own design. My team decided to pursue the idea of making a social media centered on connecting game developers and artists so that they could collaborate.  Its purpose was to encourage more collaboration between a videogames fan base and its developers as there can be more often then not a huge disconnect between where the fans of a game want developement and the direction that developers take when developing their game.
