This was our Capstone project called GART - It was developed under the idea of making a social media center where game developers and artists could collaborate and post files for sharing.  Its purpose was to encourage more collaboration between a videogames fan base and its developers as there can be more often then not a huge disconnect between where the fans of a game want developement and the direction that developers take their game ideas.
