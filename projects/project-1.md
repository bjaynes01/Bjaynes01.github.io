This Project was involved using Java to create an applications that would track the hours logged of volunteers and employees at the Aurora food Pantry. In this Project I learned that wokring and a group and sharing code amongst developers can be very tricky and difficult if you do not have good communication or time management.  We honestly struggled to get going at the beginning and learning how to use github to share code for the first time was troublesome as one of our group members (still don't know who it was) ended up uploading the wrong way and creating multiple copies of the code within the file stored in different directories in the project.  This experience was educational in the aspect that I learned how to help teamates problem solve and contribute to the group while also making sure that my individual responsibilities where being finished as well.
