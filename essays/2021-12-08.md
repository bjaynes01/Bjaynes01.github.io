## Cotton Picking: The Reason Why a Higher Percentage of African Americans are impoverished?

  Art is a window into the past.  What is meant by this is that by studying art historians can understand the emotions and experiences of different cultures and of different time periods.  Racial inequality is a common discussion topic around the world today, and history is no stranger to racial inequality or the idea of racism.  Thomas Hart Benton was the creator of the Cotton Pickers in 1945 shortly after the actual practice of sharecropping had died out.  This painting shows the sharecropping system that developed after the civil war and the hard livelihood of the freedmen (African Americans) that were sharecroppers.  Through his paintings Benton wanted to emphasize the existence of societal and racial inequality.  Slavery may have been abolished following the American Civil War, however the result of the war did not stop white landowners from exploiting the workforce of African American people.  The painting Cotton Pickers is a valuable source because it communicates the emotions of sharecroppers, shows African Americans culture, and provides insight about African Americans in poverty. 
  
Cotton Pickers is a valuable historical source because the emotions of sharecroppers are captured by it.  Thomas Hart Benton painted Cotton Pickers to capture the “back breaking work of sharecropping system following the American civil war ” and it does this rather well.  In the painting you can clearly see that the workers are not happy.  Under the tent in the bottom right of the painting you can see hidden away a very starved, thin looking African American child.  Emotionally the painting makes the viewer feel the internal emotional struggle of the sharecroppers and creates an overall sympathetic emotion within the viewer.  The child especially brought out the emotion of pity.  “Even in the best of situations, sharecropping families lived in a house and on land that was not their own. At any time, they could be evicted by their landlord .”   Their lives became plagued with debt and sorrow and a painting does those emotions more justice than words ever could.  Pictures are worth a thousand words because they generate emotions.  What people feel is what causes many of them to act.  It is not words nor texts that lead to revolution and wars, but instead the discontent, the unfairness, the ideas, and the emotions that people feel.  Cotton picker is historically relevant because it captures the emotions of sharecroppers within art so that historians and other viewers can experience those emotions for themselves.

  Another reason Cotton Pickers is historically relevant is that it provides insight into the ethnic and economic discrimination against African Americans via sharecropping.  Sharecropping is a system where the landowner allows a tenant to use the land in exchange for a share of harvest.  As depicted in the painting “sharecroppers tended to mainly grow cotton. ”  However, cotton prices fell shortly following the civil war.  This drop in cotton pricing coupled with exploitive landowners unwittingly created a system that would keep African Americans impoverished.  It was common for the share cropping tenets to have to pay and acquire the tools they needed to tend the land, and since they typically lacked money, the common practice was for sharecroppers to ask their landowners to lease them the equipment necessary to farm.  However, because of falling cotton prices very rarely would the sharecroppers be able to both pay for the leased equipment and complete the harvest payments.  Some have dubbed sharecropping system as “slavery by another name .”  Landowners took advantage of debt owed to keep sharecroppers impoverished and tied to the land.  In short, the result of the civil war did not stop landowners from exploiting African Americans using the sharecropping system.

Even today the effects of slavery, and the sharecropping system shown in Cotton Pickers can be shown to have influenced the prosperity of African Americans as a whole.  The US Census Bureau predicts that around 1959 the poverty rate for the Black population was near a shocking “55% ” and was even higher in the years before it. This measurement is nearly 20 years after the sharecropping process faded away in the 1940’s yet the African Americans clearly had a higher percentage of impoverished than the rest of the population.  The African American poverty rate has been dropping over the years, yet the African American poverty population remains one of the higher if not the highest ethnic group below the poverty line today.  “In 2019, the share of blacks in poverty was 1.8 times greater than their share among the general population.  Blacks represented 13.2% of the total population in the United States, but 23.8% of the poverty population .”  The truth is that the African American population has had a disproportionate amount of people below the poverty line since the creation of America.  African Americans had a late start on gaining monetary wealth because of slavery.  Then they got stunted again via Sharecropping which kept them impoverished following slavery for nearly another 80 years.  From this is it can be inferenced that African Americans as a group did not really have the chance to pursue economic equality until sharecropping was done away.  The fact that the African Americans poverty rate started to drop a little after sharecropping ended helps to prove this theory.  Cotton pickers helps historians to understand how the economic health of the African American culture has changed over time in America.  

  Cotton Pickers was created by Thomas Hart Benton to show the hardships of sharecropping are raise awareness of societal and economic inequality caused by sharecropping.  However, it has shown historians so much more than just the facts.  When you look at his painting you feel the sorrow, the pain, and the hardship that African American workers experienced through this exploitive system of sharecropping.  It makes you want to help the people in the painting.  Emotions that the viewer experience are synonymous with shock, sympathy, and pity.  Historical texts are great for learning about events that transpired in the past, but pictures are worth thousands of words.  Art can not only be used to document history, but immortalizes the emotions, reactions, and ideas of an event for others to experience much later in the future.  Cotton Pickers is the window into the culture in the fields as a sharecropper following the Civil War, and historians should value paintings like this as much as documentation of events they are based off.
