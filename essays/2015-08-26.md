Our lives revolve around electricity and energy.  We use it every day pretty much all the time. This might seem like something out of a TV show but people at NASA are starting to entertain the idea of sending men on missions to the planet Mars.  There are many problems and difficulties that need to be overcome to make this a possibility.  One of which is the problem of energy production on Mars.  There exists some challenges and differences between generating energy on Mars and Earth.  While a Martian Sol measures about the same time as an Earth day, so far there has been no evidence indicating that there are fossil fuels to be siphoned from Mars to power many of the devices that we will need.  A viable power source is needed to sustain life on Mars because electricity will be needed to power many of the devices and shelters needed for research and survival.   In this paper, I will write on how nuclear power, solar power, wind power, and geothermal power maybe implemented to power a Mars colony and help make life on Mars a possibility.

Many scientists have agreed that in terms of feasibility nuclear power sources are what is most likely to be necessary for our first manned missions on Mars.  “Nuclear power is a compact method for generating power in the 100 to 500 kW” range acceptable for powering a small research base to start, however even more energy would be needed to expand to an actual colony (James 29).  “NASA would be benefiting from the fact that the technology is well understood and at least one space-qualified prototype has already been produced (Voss, 1994).”  However, one major negative would be that the nuclear fission reactors would only run for 7-10 years and would produce radioactive waste that can stay around for a maximum of 4.6 billion years.  The most currently used method for nuclear waste disposal is storage, either using steel cylinders as radioactive shield or using deep and stable geologic formations. However, the disposal of nuclear waste by storage still has many concerns, since the leakage of the nuclear waste may cause huge environmental disaster (Xie 2013).  The maintenance and waste disposal from the plant will have to be carried out with caution as an accident with a nuclear reactor could be explosive and render the all-important colony uninhabitable through radiation leakage.  There is also a newer more experimental type of reactor called a nuclear fusion reactor that is still in its development stages on earth.  Should a working fusion reactor be produced it will have many advantages over its fission counterpart as it is more sustainable, and a cleaner source of energy as less radioactive waste is produced.  Site selection is also important for the nuclear power plant.  It is most likely that a “relatively deep crater will have to be selected as the site” for a nuclear reactor on Mars, because the crater will serve as protection from Mars global dust storms for both the nuclear reactor and the actual colony itself (James 29).  Nuclear Power has the potential to be the first power source used on Mars as it is well understood and the most feasible because of its stable energy production once a nuclear reaction has been initiated 
Other possible energy sources, like solar power, have been considered as alternative energy sources for powering mobile equipment once a nuclear power plant has been successfully established.  If early Mars missions are any indication, many of the devices sent to Mars have run on solar power. Solar energies greatest advantage may be its mobility.  Solar panels can be fastened pretty much anywhere the sun will touch making site selection less important than it is for other energy sources.  Also, smaller panels can be fastened to vehicles to help with energy supply when people need to venture outside of the colony or base.  Solar power is clean and efficient but may require some maintenance.  “Surface solar energy production would be highly variable due to orbital eccentricity and seasonal dust storms (James 32).”  Scientists are aware that Mars sometimes has global dust storms that could be problematic when trying to gather solar power.  These dust storms could cover solar panels with dust meaning they would have to be cleaned and would not collect power during that time.  If a person somehow gets stuck in a dust storm, there transportation rover will not be able to charge its batteries and that would possibly leave them stranded away from the colony.  Another problem is that if the dust storms become strong enough there is a chance that loose solar panels could be stripped from rovers and equipment could be damaged.  Maintenance of solar panels should be a regularly scheduled activity as it would help ensure that there are no structural weaknesses in the material used to secure the solar panels where they are.  For site selection “solar dynamic collectors would be most useful in the northern regions during the spring and summer (Zubrin, 1996).”  Here they will maximize their energy production.  It would also be a good idea to pick a location that does not have recurring dust storms as this would hinder solar power greatly.  Solar power on Mars seems like it would be less reliable then needed to sustain a living quarter, life support, and for necessary data collecting instruments.  However, it is a mobile power source and it does hold the possibility to be equipped on scientific instruments and transportation rovers as has been proven by other Mars missions.  

As solar power is being considered for deployment on Mars so too is wind power.  “Contrary to intuition, Martian wind power is a viable option (James 33).”  One advantage is that wind power produces no wastes and is totally sustainable, and one of its biggest advantages is that it requires low tech extraction technology. This is even more true on Mars.  “Mars has three advantages for successful wind power applications: less gravity (less massive components), large temperature and pressure swings, and tremendous surface relief (James 33).”  Less gravity allows for the easier construction of turbines with larger blades which allow for the capture of more wind and create more energy.  Large temperature and pressure swings help to create fast winds that will spin the turbines with speed which will create more power.  Of course, one of the disadvantages is that because of the atmosphere on Mars harnessing the winds will be much harder than on earth.  Many people argue that wind power is negligible because the atmospheric density on Mars is about 100 times less than that on Earth.  The wind will have to be blowing at a much higher MPH to generate energy comparable to Earth wind power.  Like solar power, wind power is a variable resource that does not produce a constant energy output.  It will most likely need to be paired with energy storage devices such as rechargeable batteries to make the most of the power generated by them. What’s more is that "wind power and solar power may complement each other on Mars. When you have a large dust storm blocking the sunlight on Mars, a wind turbine can still generate electricity," said scientist David Bubenheim of NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley (Bluck 2001).  Scientists believe that wind turbines will generate the most power during dust storms when the wind is blowing at its hardest.  As it would seem the wind turbines can compensate for solar panels being blocked out by the dust storm because they generate energy the best when solar panels can barely generate any energy at all.  Wind turbines can readily be assembled on Mars using available metallics on Mars and the materials for solar panels can also be brought along.  This implies that once a nuclear power plant has been established if more energy is needed for expansion a solar-wind hybrid system could be built to increase the amount of energy production.  This solar-wind hybrid system would make for a good choice for implementation after a nuclear reactor have been set up to power main life support in a Martian colony or base.  They would produce more energy and allow for the expansion of a colony.  We do need a nuclear reactor to produce energy so that we can start a colony, but our goal should be to create a sustainable energy supply using Mars natural energy sources.

Scientists believe that geothermal energy production will be key in establishing a sustainable Martian colony.  When compare with nuclear reactors, that have a limitation on how long they can run on their fuel source, geothermal energy could provide us with clean sustainable energy that will last much longer and be much stronger then nuclear reactors.  However, the tools needed to extract electrical power from geothermal resources will be troublesome to set up on Mars.  The first challenge is finding where to drill.  The CO2 that will be harnessed and liquified to create steam for electric generators will need to be within a harvestable range from the Martian colony.  So, site selection is something that scientist will need to be paying attention to when setting up to harvest geothermal energy.  The second “challenge is to figure out a way to drill with low power; as you only can drill as fast as the power you have (Dorminey 2016).”  Drills run on electrical power, it is like that saying: ‘you have to spend money, to make money.’  Using geothermal energy comes with some challenges, but the “direct use of geothermal energy for heating has been demonstrated to attain efficiencies of close to 90% (Fogg, 1996).”  Scientists already have a well understood process for generating heat on Mars and the climate control of habitation segments of a research base or colony will be key in making life more comfortable on Mars.  Martian weather is very cold.  The average temperature is usually somewhere around negative 60 degrees Celsius, however temperatures can get as low as 195 degrees Celsius.  Most places on Earth do not come anywhere near these temperatures, therefore it is too cold to send a person to Mars without having some sort of indoor climate heating.  Nuclear will be the first power sourced use for a Martian base, however geothermal power will be the endgame power source to be implemented on Mars and will allow for massive amounts of energy to be harvested from the very planet itself.  Of course, it will take time for scientist figure out a good system in which to extract the geothermal energy from the planet.  

In conclusion, no single energy source will be enough to provide enough energy for a colony on Mars.  Just as we use a variety of energy sources here on earth, we will need to use a variety of energy sources on Mars.  Nuclear power seems the most viable for the initial power source because its technology is well understood and can be reliably harnessed. The mobile solar power can be used on transportation and scientific instruments away from the base camp on Mars.  Also, the solar and wind power complement each other as one can maximize its energy production when the other is struggling to produce energy.  The harnessing of Martian geothermal energy would be the end goal as harnessing the planets natural resources to produce power would make a Mars colony truly sustainable.  We are still some years away from sending men to Mars like in Mark Watney’s movie “The Martian”.  However, it appears that we may see an attempt within the next 30 years or so.
